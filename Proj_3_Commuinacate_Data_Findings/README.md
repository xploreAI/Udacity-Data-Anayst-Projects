# Project 3 --> Ford GoBike System Data Flights analysis and visualization.
## by Mubarak Hamza
### Project overview
This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, I will conduct an exploratory data analysis on Ford GoBike System Data Flights dataset. I will use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships. 
In the second part, I will take my main findings from my exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, I will create a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate my results. This part of the project should make heavy use of the first part of the project.


### Step 1.1: Choose your Dataset
I choose Ford GoBike bike ride data from 2018/01 to 2019/02 for my project. The data was downloaded from here https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data. The data is about bike ride date, station information, member type, gender and age.

### Step 2: Explore The Dataset
I'll Explore the data and document my findings in a report. The report will briefly introduce the dataset, then systematically walk through the points of exploration that I conducted.

### Step 3: Document The Story
At the end of the exploration, I'll probably have a bunch of things that I’ve discovered. So I'm going to organize my findings and select a story that I will convey to others. Then summarize my main findings and reflect on the steps I took in my data exploration in this readme document.

### Summary of Findings
In the exploration, I found that there are two types of clients using the system: subscribers who are mainly daily commuters, having short trips to and from work, who rent a bike on weekdays and customers, usually tourists or occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends to explore the Bay Area.Moreover, I have checked if there are some differences in trends for genders. In most cases the trend for males/females was the same, except of the fact that males tend to have slightly longer trips.
